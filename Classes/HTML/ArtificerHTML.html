    <h1>Artificer</h1>

<h2>Ability Scores</h2>
<span> I will assume you use point buy, since it's almost allways allowed.</span>
<ul class="list-group">Stat prority
<li class="list-group-item">Str: <span> (8)  Dump stat</span> </li>
<li class="list-group-item">Dex: <span> (14) You'll want some Dexterity to fill out your AC at low levels.</span></li>
<li class="list-group-item">Con: <span> (15) Always essential.</span></li>
<li class="list-group-item">Int: <span> (14) Your primary stat. Fuels your spells and all of your class features.</span> </li>
<li class="list-group-item">Wis: <span> (12) Technically a dump stat, but it complements many of your skills nicely so it may be helpful to put some points into it. </span> </li>
<li class="list-group-item">Cha: <span> (8) Dump stat</span></li> 
</ul> 



<span>Tinker is the Rock Gnome’s only particularly complicated trait, but it offers a fun way to embrace the Artificer’s theme</span>
<h2>Race</h2>
<span>Rock Gnome. The Intelligence increase brings us to 16, and the Constitution increase brings us to 16, which makes us effective with your class features and reasonably durable.
Tinker is the Rock Gnome’s only particularly complicated trait, but it offers a fun way to embrace the Artificer’s theme.</span>
<h2>Skills and Tools</h2>
<span>The Artificer gets two skills from their class list, one type of Artisan’s tools, and two fixed tools. Guild Artisan will add Insight, Persuasion, an extra set of artisan’s tools. Pick whatever artisan’s tools sound like fun.</span>
<h2>Background</h2>
<span>Guild Artisan. The skill proficiencies aren’t fantastic for the artificer, but there are few backgrounds which are setting-agnostic and work well. The Failed Merchant out of Acquisitions Incorporated works well, and starts you with some very expensive starting equipment.</span>
<h2>Feats</h2>
<span>This build doesn’t require feats. At high levels you might consider feats once you reach 20 Intelligence, but it’s not strictly necessary.</span>

        <th>For your starting gear, take two daggers, a light crossbow and 20 bolts, scale mail, theives’ tools, and a dungeoneering pack. The crossbow is useful when enemies are outside of your cantrip range, but you’ll have better results if you sell it and use the gold to but a shield.

 

            At this level your options are really limited. You’ll feel more like a weird wizard than like an actual artificer. Keep your shield out, prepare spells that will keep you alive, and just try to make it to 2nd level. Fire Bolt will deal enough damage to make you useful in combat, and you long list of proficiencies, Tinker, and Magical Tinkering give you plenty of utility options outside of combat. Bring Cure Wounds to help your allies in combat, but try to avoid using it until you absolutely need to do so; you only have two spell slots.</th></tr>

        <th>Level 2 is where the Artificer really starts to feel like they should. You don’t get any more spell slots, but 2 magic items can be a massive improvement to your capabilities.

 

            If you need nothing else, use Enhanced Arcane Focus and Enhanced Defense to boost your spell attacks and your AC. +1 to AC will bring you up to 19 AC, giving you nearly as much AC as a fighter in full plate. If you have allies to defend you, consider sharing Enhanced Defense and/or Enhanced Weapon.</th>

         <th>       Third level brings a lot of good things. You get another 1st-level spell slot just in time to get an expanded spell list, including the absolutely essential Healing Word. You can stop preparing Cure Wounds, and instead rely on Healing Word for emergency healing in combat. <br> <br>

 

         The Alchemist gains proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies, but we got that at first level, so you get to replace it with any other tool proficiency. <br> <br>
         
          
         
         The Right Tool for the Job doesn’t change much, but it’s basically a free set of tools. <br>
         
          
         
         This level also brings Experimental Elixir. The free elixir won’t reliably be something that you can count on, but you can turn spells itno elixirs to get a bunch of useful buffs.

  5th level also brings 2nd-level spells. The Alchemist’s spell list offers two offensive options, so be sure to prepare something else that will make good use of your 2nd-level spell slots.</th>
