    <h1>Artificer</h1>

<h2>Abilities</h2>


<h2>Ability Scores</h2>
<span> I will assume you use point buy, since it's almost allways allowed.</span>
<ul class="list-group">Stat prority
<li class="list-group-item">Str: <span> (8)  Dump stat</span> </li>
<li class="list-group-item">Dex: <span> (14) You'll want some Dexterity to fill out your AC at low levels.</span></li>
<li class="list-group-item">Con: <span> (14) Always essential.</span></li>
<li class="list-group-item">Int: <span> (15) Your primary stat. Fuels your spells and all of your class features.</span> </li>
<li class="list-group-item">Wis: <span> (12) Technically a dump stat, but it complements many of your skills nicely so it may be helpful to put some points into it. </span> </li>

<span>Tinker is the Rock Gnome’s only particularly complicated trait, but it offers a fun way to embrace the Artificer’s theme</span>
<h2>Race</h2>
<span>Rock Gnome. The Intelligence increase brings us to 16, and the Constitution increase brings us to 16, which makes us effective with your class features and reasonably durable.
Tinker is the Rock Gnome’s only particularly complicated trait, but it offers a fun way to embrace the Artificer’s theme.</span>
<h2>Skills and Tools</h2>
<span>The Artificer gets two skills from their class list, one type of Artisan’s tools, and two fixed tools. Guild Artisan will add Insight, Persuasion, an extra set of artisan’s tools. Pick whatever artisan’s tools sound like fun.</span>
<h2>Background</h2>
<span>Guild Artisan. The skill proficiencies aren’t fantastic for the artificer, but there are few backgrounds which are setting-agnostic and work well. The Failed Merchant out of Acquisitions Incorporated works well, and starts you with some very expensive starting equipment.</span>
<h2>Feats</h2>
<span>This build doesn’t require feats. At high levels you might consider feats once you reach 20 Intelligence, but it’s not strictly necessary.</span>
